# Functions

1. Functions in Javascript are objects.
2. Objects are collections of name/value pairs having hidden link to a prototype object.
3. Functions objects are linked to **Function.prototype** which is itself linked to **Object.prototype**
4. Functions can be stored in variables, objects, and arrays. Functions can be passed as arguments to functions, and functions can be returned from functions. Also, since functions are objects, functions can have methods.
